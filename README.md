## Problem Statement:

It is projected that by the year 2025, 60% of the world’s land mass and billions of people will find themselves in the water-scarce situation. At a minimum world will face economic challenges from this water scarcity, and at the maximum the world will face a grave humanitarian crisis. Hundreds of millions of people will suddenly find themselves in places where there once was water but there is no longer.

According to a ‘NitiAayog’ report on water management index last year, India is currently suffering from the worst water crisis in its history with the country ranked at 120 among 122 countries in the quality of water. By 2020, it said, as many as 21 major cities of India including Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, and Hyderabad will run out of water.

India is among the world’s most water-stressed countries. Yet,India remains one of the largest water users per unit of GDP.This suggests that the way in which India manages its scarce water resources accounts for much of its water woes. Government capacities are lacking as far as improving water management is concerned, while policies and incentives often favor inefficient and unproductive use of water. It’s high time we all have to be conscious for our most valuable resource of Earth.

## Solutions:

JEEVAN is a single platform for water management system, where we can measure, monitor and predict the usage of water at a per capita basis of the gross domestic product (GDP). There are many organizations which are already doing a bits and pieces of work for the water crisis awareness and water management, but there is no single platform where everyone can reach out and get the information regarding the water usage at a per capita basis and can also get the information of the water usage of an area and can also get the information regarding the prediction of the water usage for the upcoming 5 years. JEEVAN is an open-source AI enabled platform that serves as a one-stop for the water usage measure, monitor, prediction and can also check the water wastage at a very granular level.

For Users, JEEVAN is an extremely easy-to-use, user-friendly platform where the user can measure the water usage of the family and can also check the flowrate of the water. The user can also get aware of the leakage, if any, by using this platform and can control the water wastage.

JEEVAN is computable – JEEVAN measures the usage of water for individual family and also monitors the flowrate of each family and the total usage of water in an area. By using JEEVAN we can keep a track on the water consumption of each family and as a result we can control the unnecessary wastage of water.

JEEVAN is intelligent – JEEVAN keeps a track of the continuous flow rate of each family and can also monitor if there is any water leakage occurred in any pipeline and send an email to the registered user where the leakage is detected. By using JEEVAN we can easily track if any leakage occurs and can take actions on that leakage without wasting a lot of water.

JEEVAN is AI enabled – JEEVAN platform is AI- enabled, it is trained over 10 years of water consumption data over different postal areas. It can predict the water usage of all the postal areas for the upcoming 5 years. By using JEEVAN we can get a clear scenario of the water scarcity that may occur in the upcoming years and as a result we can get aware of the scenario and control the unnecessary wastage of water.


Scopes and the potential use-cases of JEEVAN is endless – We usually measure the usage of the electricity internet telephone and pay the bills, but we forget to measure the usage of the water and as a result we do unnecessary wastage in the areas where we get water easily and on the other side the areas those who face water scarcity has to fight even for drinking water. By using JEEVAN we can get a clear scenario of the areas that will face the water stress in the near future. We can restrict the unnecessary wastage of water and can transmit the conserved water to the nearby area where the water scarcity hits. By doing so we can atleast give some water to those who starve for the drinking water. By using the JEEVAN platform the Governments and other welfare organizations that works for the water crisis awareness program and the water management program can get the easy access to the detailed information’s of the water usage and the prediction of the scarcity of water and as a result they can take the proper precautions steps to control the scenario’s.

## Architecture:

JEEVAN platform uses node MCU as a smart hardware device which is integrated with the Wifi and will be embedded with the Digital watermeter that will read the data reading of the meter and will send it to the IBM cloud using the MQTT protocol. JEEVAN as a platform is completely based on IBM cloud using 4 IBM services
